Norman Bertolino is one of those people whose love for film is immediately obvious even within a few minutes of speaking with him. The director oozes love and awe of great film and the art that a great director can make. To listen to Bertolino talk is to get a lesson in film and technique. He doesn’t have to tell you he is a filmmaker and director, you figure it out on your own.

Bertolino doesn’t make movies just to make movies. His desire is to tell memorable stories and create visual images that stick in the heads of those that see his work. He has already directed some successful short films, with one, “Roadside Fling,” just premiering at the Burbank International Film Festival this past summer. And he is preparing to take the reins on his first feature-length movie in the coming months. Bertolino is not one to just do any project, preferring instead to do only work that he knows is fitting with the standards of storytelling that he has learned from directors he admires.

Bertolino knows that to be successful it means doing movies that are commercially successful at some point. But he also believes there can be a balance between movies that make money and are at the same time, works that stand the test of time because they are done well. He is not against directing commercial movies. He just wants to balance that with a lasting film that others will one day aspire to the way he looked up to some others.
